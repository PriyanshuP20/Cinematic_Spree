INTRODUCTION  
  
The emergence of modern technologies has had profound impacts on almost everything including ticket booking, so how can the cinema stay away from technology? With the internet now anyone can book the movie ticket of their choice at their fingertips. The main advantages of online ticket booking are flexibility and accessibility, allowing users to book tickets from anywhere for a specific day, and pre-planning for an off day is easier now. The pain of standing in the queue is now gone, a click and we can have our tickets in our hands. However, there is a need for more development in this sector of booking, not everything available online is perfect, here with the Cinematic Spree we tried to eliminate some of them. The purpose of this project is to develop a back-end application for online ticket booking using graphical user interface.  



PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

 This project aims to develop a back-end application for a movie ticket booking app using a graphical user interface. It allows for a flexible and user-friendly ticket booking interface which gives a seamless experience to the users.
